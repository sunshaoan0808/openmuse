> **Alpha, for self-hosting and building on.** Open-ended reasoning, live Google accounts, and CopilotKit Rich Threads require their own configuration. See [what is verified](docs/VERIFICATION.md) and the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Demo

On iPhone, ask OpenMuse to find interesting stories on Hacker News and summarize CopilotKit. On desktop, ask it to check the school-trip email, open the message, and research exhibits at Monterey Bay Aquarium. The agent shows email and browser results inline. **Take control** opens that same browser session when you need it.

The 38-second iPhone and 42-second desktop web demos show the current interface, framed in 16:9. The send arrow becomes a stop square inside the input pill while the agent replies, then switches back. Stopping keeps your draft intact. See the [recording notes](docs/DEMO.md) for the model setup and reproduction steps.

## What it is

OpenMuse is a personal-agent application with an agent computer, visible work, and rich results. It runs its own server, task worker, and browser worker. You can inspect and change the source under the MIT license.

The computer combines **persistent Chromium and an optional Linux workspace**. The agent can browse public pages, run commands in its own container, work with files, and move PDFs between the computer and the app. You can open its browser or terminal and continue the work. Graphical desktops and autonomous checkout remain future work.

## Features

| Surface | What runs in this alpha |
| --- | --- |
| **Chat** | CopilotKit headless chat with streamed AG-UI events, mailbox search and reading, send/stop in one input pill, a visible follow-up queue, retained drafts, delegated tasks, and inline email, browser, PDF, plan, and finance cards. |
| **Agent computer** | Persistent browser profiles and takeover console; optional isolated Linux terminal, saved command receipts, editable workspace files, and PDF transfer. |
| **Activity** | Durable task plans, progress, input requests, pause/resume/cancel/retry, approvals, and saved receipts. SQL leases recover interrupted work. |
| **Ideas** | Suggestions with source evidence; edit, accept, or dismiss. Sent replies and completed matching work are excluded. |
| **Goals & Tracking** | Goals and milestones; recurring public-page checks for changes, text availability, or USD price thresholds, with deduplicated alerts and failure backoff. |
| **Documents** | Email attachment → PDF → requested form values → filled copy → reviewed reply → receipt. Native/web PDF viewing, paging, zoom, supported fields, and sharing. |
| **Finance** | Import transaction CSV to create a spending summary with categories, transactions, and a savings-goal action. |
| **Gmail & Calendar** | Google OAuth adapters, complete mail threads, drafts/attachments, calendar discovery, and reviewed event creation/update/deletion. Live credentials required. |
| **Personal context** | Editable name, tone, avatar, and memories. Background-update preferences and durable in-app notifications. |
| **Rich Threads** | CopilotKit Intelligence persistence in every mode, with a stable main conversation, side chats, renaming, archiving, restoring, and replay. A server-only project key is required. |

The [feature inventory](docs/FEATURES.md) describes implemented capabilities and planned extensions. Health/bank/social connectors, device push, voice, generated executable tools, and automatic reservations/payments are on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Node 24 LTS, pnpm 11.19.0, and a CopilotKit Intelligence project key. The local sample app needs no model, Google account, or Docker.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenMuse.git openmuse
cd openmuse
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env
npx copilotkit@latest login
npx copilotkit@latest project select
# Set CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY in .env to the generated server-only project key.
pnpm dev
```

In another terminal:

```sh
pnpm dev:web
```

Open [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081). The API runs at [localhost:8787/api/health](http://localhost:8787/api/health).

### Try it

1. In Chat, send **“Complete the permission slip”**. Open the task, supply fictional form values, inspect the saved PDF, and review the prepared reply. This writes only to the local mailbox.
2. In **Goals → Track**, create a built-in availability watch, then change the built-in test page to trigger an alert.
3. In **Menu → Delegate task → Finance**, use **Try example transactions** to create an interactive spending tracker.
4. Start the [browser worker](#browser-worker) and configure a model, then ask **“Check out Hacker News for cool stuff”** or **“Summarize copilotkit.ai”**. Follow the browser inline and use **Take control** to open its session. For a model-free version of this flow, follow the [AI Mock demo setup](docs/DEMO.md#run-the-agent-browser-demo).

For iOS or Android, use `pnpm --dir apps/mobile ios` or `pnpm --dir apps/mobile android`. Xcode or Android tooling is required. The PDF reader needs an Expo development build; use [native setup](apps/mobile/README.md).

## Configure the agent and Google

Copy the commented settings in [.env.example](.env.example) into your private `.env`:

1. Set `AGENT_BACKEND=model`, `MODEL=provider/model-id`, and the matching provider key. CopilotKit supports the configured OpenAI, Anthropic or Google provider. Fictional data can still be used with a real model. Provider keys stay on the server.
2. Create or select a CopilotKit Intelligence project with `npx copilotkit@latest login` and `npx copilotkit@latest project select`. Keep the generated `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` on the server.
3. For personal mail/calendar, set `WORKSPACE_MODE=live`, the generated `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY`, a random `OPENMUSE_ACCESS_KEY` of at least 24 characters, and `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` containing 32 random bytes encoded as base64. Restart the API.
4. Configure a Google OAuth web client with Gmail and Calendar APIs enabled. Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`; register `${PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/google/callback` as its redirect URI. Configure consent/test-user access in your Google project.
5. Open **Apps → Gmail** (or **Google Calendar**), connect read access, and grant write access when needed. Every send or calendar change still requires its own stored review. Changing/disconnecting the account invalidates pending connection-bound work.

Google credentials are encrypted at rest. File URLs and browser consoles use short-lived signatures. This deployment uses one owner protected by a shared access key; it is not a multi-tenant authentication system. Use HTTPS and restricted network access for a remote host. Keep the default local-data mode on loopback.

## Browser worker

Set `BROWSER_WORKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8790` and a random `WORKER_TOKEN` of at least 32 characters in `.env`.

```sh
pnpm --dir apps/worker exec patchright install chromium
pnpm dev:browser
```

Or use `docker compose --env-file .env -f infra/compose.yaml up --build -d`. The same token must reach the API and worker. Sessions have persistent Chromium profiles; the app can open a live screenshot console and import PDF downloads. Agent tools can read public pages, list a page's actionable elements by ref and click/fill/select/scroll through them (`page_elements`, `page_act`), look at the rendered page through a vision model (`look_page`), and hand interactive work to the person — the human console shows the same session, at desktop or phone viewport, with history navigation. [Worker setup and boundaries](apps/worker/README.md).

## Web search

Chat search is a server-side pipeline: it fetches a SERP, parses it into structured results (title, URL, snippet), and reads the top pages in parallel, so answers carry real source URLs instead of scraped page noise.

Keyword engines block datacenter IPs, so the order is: configured API first, then scraping, and every result list passes a relevance check — an engine that answers with an unrelated "decoy" SERP (Bing does this to hosted IPs) is rejected rather than answered.

```sh
# Recommended: a real search API (Brave free tier works) …
SEARCH_API_KEY=...
SEARCH_PROVIDER=brave          # brave | tavily | serper

# … or a self-hosted SearXNG with JSON output enabled
SEARCH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8888
```

Without either, search falls back to scraping (DuckDuckGo HTML over plain HTTP currently works; Brave works through the browser worker but rate-limits quickly) and reports an honest error when every backend fails, instead of inventing results.

## Persistence and operation

### Linux terminal and workspace

Build the computer image, enable it on the API, then open **Computer → Terminal → Start computer**:

```sh
docker build -t openmuse-computer:local apps/computer
COMPUTER_ENABLED=true pnpm dev
```

The API needs access to the Docker CLI and engine. Commands run in a nonroot container with no host-directory mounts or credentials. A named `/workspace` volume retains files when stopped. Terminal networking is disabled; public web access uses the browser worker. Commands have a 30-second limit and saved output/exit receipts. **Files** supports folders, text editing, and PDF transfer to/from Documents. This is a Linux container, not a full operating-system VM. [Setup, Colima option, and boundaries](docs/COMPUTER.md).

### Application storage

By default, embedded PGlite, documents and the signing key live in `.openmuse/`; browser profiles live in `.openmuse/browser-profiles/`. Keep that directory private and back it up. The API hosts the task worker. The host must remain running for background work.

For a separate task worker, configure the same `DATABASE_URL`, secrets and shared `DATA_DIR` for both processes, then set `TASK_WORKER_ENABLED=false` on the API and run `pnpm dev:worker`. PGlite cannot be opened by separate processes. Production commands are `pnpm build:server`, `pnpm start` and `pnpm start:worker`. Run one API instance; task workers coordinate through SQL leases.

No hidden retry occurs after an uncertain external write. Review its provider outcome before creating a replacement. Pausing/cancelling prevents subsequent task steps; an already approved in-flight provider request may finish.

## CopilotKit Rich Threads

Every deployment requires `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` on the API server for CopilotKit Intelligence conversation persistence and replay. Create or select a project with `npx copilotkit@latest login` and `npx copilotkit@latest project select`, set the generated server-only key, and restart the API. The native menu uses `useThreads`; rich tool results link back to saved tasks, documents, and browser sessions.

Intelligence is a separate service and is not included in this repository's MIT license. No project key is shipped. [Configuration and validation boundaries](docs/RICH-THREADS.md).

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/mobile` | Shared iOS, Android, and web UI with CopilotKit headless hooks. |
| `apps/server` | API, CopilotKit runtime, identity boundary, task engine, reviews, files, and persistence. |
| `apps/worker` | Token-protected [Patchright](https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright) browser service (Playwright fork with CDP-leak patches) with persistent profiles; runs headed under Xvfb when `BROWSER_HEADLESS=false`. |
| `apps/computer` | Nonroot Linux image, bounded filesystem helper, and real container verification. |
| `packages/domain` | Shared types and request validation. |
| `packages/integrations` | Google and browser protocol adapters. |
| `packages/backends` | Optional OpenBot HTTP adapter and its identity boundary. |
| `tests` | Workflow, runtime, persistence, provider-contract, and authorization tests. |

### OpenBot compatibility

OpenMuse's native client and personal-agent workflows are independent of OpenBot. The disabled OpenBot adapter is pinned and contract-tested against upstream interfaces. Live user/session bridging, routine mapping, and computer backend wiring remain future work. OpenBot's Intelligence runtime is not a raw AG-UI endpoint. [Integration contract](docs/OPENBOT-INTEGRATION.md).

Platform build scripts export JavaScript/Hermes bundles; they do not produce signed app binaries. Browser checks require installed Chromium and public fixture access. CI also exercises the browser and Linux computer containers. See [contribution guidance](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [verification results](docs/VERIFICATION.md).
